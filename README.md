## Hi!

I'm Sofie. I am a Software Engineer who just loves coding, debugging, documenting, testing, nitpicking and fine-tuning. I prefer code to be sufficiently robust and modular, and I care a great deal about user experience (UX) and quality assurance (QA). I always love to do the simple thing first 🛖, then build up the complexity as required 🏛️.

I have a PhD in Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🎓 and I've been working in NLP and ML ever since my Master's back in 2007. I run a one-woman company called [OxyKodit](https://oxykodit.com/) to implement tailored solutions for a variety of businesses and domains - because who wouldn't benefit from NLP in their company? I find it extremely satisfying to dive into a client's business context and NLP needs, and to come up with a solution that will bring actual real-world value to them 🤓.

I'm passionate about open-source 🐍. I've written some (now out-dated) software back at Uni, and for several years I've been a core maintainer of the NLP library [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy), its deep learning library [Thinc](https://github.com/explosion/thinc), and various other repo's in the same 💥 ecosystem. I'm currently also helping out with maintenance of [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer). An interview with Once a Maintainer about my journey into open-source can be found [here](https://onceamaintainer.substack.com/p/once-a-maintainer-sofie-van-landeghem).

Shoot me an [email](https://oxykodit.com/#footer) if you'd like to work together!
